SCHOOL PROJECT 3-DATASTRUCTURES

L-System Tree Drawer and Flappy Bird with L-System Trees

--- OVERVIEW ---

This project is a combination of two components:
                                     - a L-System tree generator implemented in C++ (LSystemInterpreter).
                                     - a Python script for drawing trees and creating a Flappy Bird game using L-System trees (LSystemDrawer).

--- L-SYSTEM TREE GENERATOR (C++) ---

The C++ code i wrote you can find under the LSystemInterpreter folder.

You can find the L-System data structure in the Include and Source files.

In the `MainTest.cpp` file, L-Systems are written to a text file and the LSystem is tested for correct implementation.
Each L-System represents a set of rules that define the growth of a tree.
The generated L-Systems are then used by the Python script to draw trees.

--- L-SYSTEM TREE DRAWER (Python) ---

The Python code i wrote you can find under the LSystemDrawer folder.

In the conversion folder you can find the codes i needed to convert files into .gif files so i can use them with turtle
Here i also drew a LSystemTree using turtle and then converted that drawing into a .gif file.

In the flappybird folder you can find all the code that's relevant to the flappybird.py game

In the LSystemTurtle.py file you can either draw an evolution of a tree, or draw a collage of trees and plants.

The 'drawEvolutionTree(filename, distance, angle)' function you can use to draw the different stages of a tree.
The 'drawCollageTrees(...)' function you can use to draw a collage of trees.
It's important to know that these functions only work for my particular trees and I made it nice by adding some birds and a sun.
So if you want to make your own collage, you will have to change some things in the LSystemTurtle.py file.

--- USAGE ---

To use my project you first have to run the TEST_CASES from the LSYSTEMLIB library in c++ so the .txt files get written into.
You will have to change the directories to your own wanted directories.

When the .txt are written you can use the python terminal to run the different codes.

For the flappybird game you simply have to write: python flappybird.py

But if you want to draw a collage of trees you will have to put the 'drawEvolutionTree' file in comments.
If you want to draw the evolution of a tree you will have to put the 'drawCollageTrees' file in comments.

After this you can run the code by writing: 'python LSystemTurtle.py' in the terminal
